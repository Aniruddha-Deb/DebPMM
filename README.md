# DebPMM

## Background
This document came about as a result of an inter-school quiz. I was one of the 
pivotal members of the organising committee and was in charge of creating the 
buzzer. The process of creation of the buzzer, and as a whole, the organisation 
of the quiz, led to the creation of this methodology.

## Project stages: 
Each project has 5 stages, which are as follows:
### Initialization:
Listing down of
* Objective
* Product Description
* Title
* Target market
* Market research

### Planning:
* Bill of materials
* Implementation plan
* Project schematic
* <software> Architecture plan

### Implementation:
* Material sourcing
* Assembly
* Testing

### Maintenance
* Identifying bugs and fixing them
* User request changes
* Pushing security + usability improvements

### Closure
* Project conclusion
* Project takeaways
